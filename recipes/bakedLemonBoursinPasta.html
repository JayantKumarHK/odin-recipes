    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      There's no denying it: Boursin Cheese is having a moment this summer, and
      itâ€™s all thanks to TikTok. Videos of home cooks making baked Boursin Lemon
      Pasta have amassed millions of views on the social media app, with many
      creators praising the dish for its one-pot simplicity and fresh flavors.
      Boursin, which is the brand name for a French style of cheese called
      Gournay cheese, is known for its creamy texture and garlicky flavor. It
      hails from Northern France, where it first gained popularity in the early
      '60s. Today, Boursin is a household name, and its versatility has made it
      a popular choice among cooks and creators on social media. Now the cheese
      is behind a viral pasta trend that calls to mind another baked cheese
      pasta that we still make to this day.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 5.2 ounce package of Boursin Garlic & Fine Herbs Cheese</li>
      <li>1 head of garlic</li>
      <li>1 lemon, halved</li>
      <li>1 medium shallot, peeled and sliced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>
        1 pound dried pasta of your choice, cooked according to package
        instructions
      </li>
      <li>lemon zest and crushed red pepper flakes for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Unwrap the Boursin cheese and place it in the center of an 8x8-inch
        baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut the top off the garlic to expose the cloves and place in the dish,
        clove-side-up. Add the lemon halves, face down, and shallot to the dish.
        Sprinkle with black pepper and oregano and drizzle with olive oil. Bake
        for 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the oven and allow to cool for a few minutes. Using your
        hands or a handheld lemon press, squeeze the juice from the roasted
        lemon halves into the dish, taking care not to get any seeds in the
        dish. Squeeze the roasted garlic head to release the cloves into the
        dish.
      </li>
      <li>Mix all of the contents of the baking dish together until a smooth, creamy sauce forms.</li>
      <li>Add the cooked pasta to the baking dish and stir to coat.</li>
      <li>Serve topped with fresh lemon zest and crushed red pepper flakes, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
